- Statement of purpose: The purpose of this application is to provide people interested in adventure travel within Australia the chance to book adventure activities in the city of their choice using a simple, user-friendly app. 
- The problem to be solved in this application is providing a simple travel app for adventure enthusiasts to book their travel. I am developing the app to cater for a niche section of the travel market.
- The target audience is those people who are booking travel specifically to take part in select adventure activities located in the capital cities throughout Australia.
- The target audience will use the application by:
    1. Clicking on the app, which will produce a welcome message and a prompt to start using the app.
    2. Registering with the adventure travel company by entering their contact details: first name, last name, home address and email address (input).
        - The app will check that all user details have been entered.
        - If any of the fields are missing, the user is prompted to "try again".
        - The successful entry of a user's details will prompt the message "Welcome to Adventure Travel!" with the following main menu options to choose from:
            - View list of adventure activities (Brisbane and Sydney)
            - Book your adventure
            - Cancel your booking
            - Exit the app
    3. Viewing a list of activities available in the cities Brisbane and Sydney.
    4. Selecting a city and an adventure activity followed by the message prompt "Do you want to book this adventure?"
    5. Selecting from the options "Yes, I want to book this adventure" or "No, take me back to the list of activities".
        - If the selected option is "Yes", they will be prompted by the message "When do you want to travel?"
        - If the selected option is "No", they will be taken back to step 4 (Selecting a city and an adventure activity).
    6. Selecting from a list of available dates for the activity and city followed by the message "You are booked for x activity in x city on the x date. Your booking ID is x".
    7. Selecting the option "cancel your booking" prompts the message "Are you sure that you want to cancel this activity?"
        - If the selected option is "Yes", they will be prompted by the message "Please enter your booking ID."
            - The user will enter their booking ID. 
            - The app will check that the booking ID has been entered.
            - If the booking ID is missing, the user is prompted to "try again".
            - The successful entry of the user's booking ID will prompt the message "We have confirmed your booking cancellation."
            - The user will be taken back to the main menu.
        - If the selected option is "No", the user will be taken back to the main menu.
