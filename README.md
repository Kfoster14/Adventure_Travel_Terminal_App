## <font color="blue">R5. Design a Software Development Plan for a terminal application. The following requirements provide details of what needs to be included in this plan,
- Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application. It must include:
    - describe at a high level what the application will do
    - identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
    - identify the target audience
    - explain how a member of the target audience will use it</font>

- Statement of purpose: The purpose of this application is to provide people interested in adventure travel within Australia the chance to book adventure activities in either Sydney or Brisbane using a simple, user-friendly app. 
- The problem to be solved in this application is to provide a simple travel app for adventure enthusiasts to book their travel. I am developing the app to cater for a niche section of the travel market.
- The target audience is people who are booking travel specifically to take part in select adventure activities located in the cities Brisbane and Sydney.

- The target audience will use the application by:
    

- variables and variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- write and utilise simple functions
- error handling
- input and output
- importing a Ruby Gem
- using functions from a Ruby Gem

## <font color="blue">R6. Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

The 3 features included in the application are:
1. The ability for a user to view a list of adventure activities in two cities (Brisbane and Melbourne) on various upcoming dates.
    - 

2. The ability to book an adventure activity.


3. The ability to cancel a booking for an adventure activity.

Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling</font>

## <font color="blue">R7. Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user</font>

The user will be able to use and interact with the travel app as described below.
The user can:
1. Click on the app, which will produce a welcome message "Welcome to Adventure Travel!" and a prompt for the user to click on the main menu.
2. Select from one of the following main menu options:
    - List of adventure activities
        - Brisbane
        - Sydney
    - Book your adventure
    - Cancel your booking
    - Exit the app
3. View a list of adventure activities available in the cities of Brisbane and Sydney.
4. Select a city, an adventure activity in the selected city and an available date, followed by the message prompt "Would you like to book this adventure?"
5. Select from the options "Yes, I want to book this adventure" or "No, take me back to the list of activities".
    - If the selected option is "Yes", they will be prompted by the message "Please register your details."
        - Register with the adventure travel company by entering their contact details: first name, last name, home address and email address (input).
        - The app will check that all user details have been entered.
        - If any of the fields are missing, the user is prompted to "try again", otherwise the message ("Thank you for your details. You are now registered. Your booking ID number is x." will be displayed and a booking ID number generated for the chosen activity/city/date.
    - If the selected option is "No", the user will be taken back to step 3 to view the list of activities.
6. Select the option "Cancel your booking", which prompts the message "Are you sure that you want to cancel this activity?"
        - If the selected option is "Yes", they will be prompted by the message "Please enter your booking ID."
            - The user will enter their booking ID. 
            - The app will check that the booking ID has been entered.
            - If the booking ID has not been entered, the user is prompted to "try again".
            - The successful entry of the user's booking ID will prompt the message "We have confirmed your booking cancellation."

## <font color="blue">R8. Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.</font>

## <font color="blue">R9. Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan

> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.</font>

A9. 

R10. Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
